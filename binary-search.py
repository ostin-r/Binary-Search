    This is just a copy of the solution for binary search from geekstogeeks.com that
    I typed up to make sure that I fully understand how it works. 
    This function, compared to my function search_numb, is much less complex.  
    This is because it changes the index of the array to search rather than "cutting" 
    it as it searches like my function search_numb above.
