# Binary-Sorting-Algorithm
Trying out my first sorting algorithm

I've done some reading on the binary search algorithm to discover how similar it is to different numerical methods that I learned in engineering school.  Instead of using mathematical functions, these sorting algorithms are concerned with more general forms of information such as strings.

My plan for this project is to:
- learn what I can about search algorithms
- implement a binary sorting function for a numbered list
- compare my solution to solutions offered by professionals on the interwebs

So far I have learned about "time complexity" which is a comparison of rates of input & computations required by the algorithm.  This is represented by an "O" followed by the n-complexity relationship.  A linear relationship between input and time complexity is O(n).

In addition, it seems natural that sorting algorithms would be the next thing that I should study.  Maybe I'll add a solution for one of those to this project.
