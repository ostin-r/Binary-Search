# Binary-Sorting-Algorithm
Trying out my first sorting algorithm

I've done some reading on binary sorting algorithms to discover how similar they are to different numerical methods that I learned in engineering school.  Instead of using mathematical functions, these sorting algorithms are concerned with more general forms of information such as strings.

My plan for this project is to:
- learn what I can about sorting algorithms
- implement a binary sorting function for a numbered list
- compare my solution to solutions offered by professionals on the interwebs

So far I have learned about "time complexity" which is a comparison of rates of input & computations required by the algorithm.  This is represented by an "O" followed by the n-complexity relationship.  A linear relationship between input and time complexity is O(n).
